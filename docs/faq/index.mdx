## Can I use Flowra without TypeScript?

Flowra is built with TypeScript in mind. While you can compile JavaScript sources, you lose decorator metadata and type safety. We recommend keeping TypeScript for container integration and IDE support.

## How do I add a new module?

Use the CLI:

```bash
npx flowra make:module <name>
```

Then register the module's routes in `main/bootstrap.ts`.

## Does Flowra support multiple databases?

Yes. Define additional connections in `config/database.ts` and inject them using `@inject('database.<name>')`. Manage migrations per connection using separate Knex config files.

## Can I run Flowra in serverless environments?

Flowra can run on serverless platforms if you manage database connections carefully. Use connection pooling proxies (e.g., PgBouncer) and keep the container bootstrap light to reduce cold start impact.

## How do I handle background jobs?

Use the CLI to scaffold job modules and integrate with a queue library such as BullMQ. Register queue instances in the container so jobs and HTTP handlers share configuration.

## Is there a built-in admin panel?

Flowra focuses on backend architecture and does not ship an admin UI. You can integrate popular admin dashboards or build custom frontends consuming Flowra's APIs.

## How do I upgrade Flowra?

Check the release notes, update dependencies via `npm install flowra@latest`, and run generated migration scripts if provided. Review breaking changes in the changelog before deploying.

## Where can I ask for help?

Open a discussion or issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/ecowangsa/flowra) and join community channels announced in the repository README.
