## Is Flowra TypeScript-first?

Flowra scaffolds CommonJS JavaScript by default. You can adopt TypeScript by adding a build step and adjusting the scaffold, but it is not required.

## Can I use a database other than MySQL?

Yes. Update `app/Config/Database.js` to use another Knex-supported client (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MSSQL). The rest of the framework stays the same.

## Does Flowra support modules outside `app/Modules`?

Modules are loaded from the manifest in `app/Modules/modules.manifest.js`. You can point entries at any path, but keeping them under `app/Modules` is recommended.

## How do I add custom middleware?

Add it in `app/Bootstrap/server.bootstrap.js` before module routes are registered.

## Why does `env:example` regenerate different variables?

`flowra env:example` is generated from the CLI schema. If you customize configuration keys, update your `.env.example` to match `app/Config/Database.js` and other config files.

## Can I disable a module without deleting files?

Yes. Use `flowra module:disable <name>` or set `enabled: false` in the manifest.
