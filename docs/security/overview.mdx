---

Flowra aims to be secure by default while keeping Express flexibility.

## Built-in protections

- **Helmet** for common HTTP header protections.
- **CORS** configuration in `app/Config/App.js`.
- **Request IDs** via `RequestContextMiddleware` for traceability.
- **Centralized error handling** with sanitized JSON responses.

## Configure CORS

CORS is enabled by default and controlled by `app/Config/App.js`:

```js title="app/Config/App.js"
http: {
  cors: {
    enabled: true,
    origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN ? process.env.CORS_ORIGIN.split(',') : ['*'],
    credentials: true,
  },
}
```

## Add rate limiting

The scaffold includes a `rateLimit` config section but does not wire it by default. You can add `express-rate-limit` in `app/Bootstrap/server.bootstrap.js` if needed.

## Sessions and cookies

Flowra includes `cookie-parser`. Add `express-session` or a JWT strategy depending on your requirements.

## Operational hygiene

- Use `flowra env:check` to verify required environment variables.
- Keep `.env` files out of source control.
- Rotate secrets regularly and prefer a secrets manager in production.
