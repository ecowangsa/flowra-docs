Flowra is a standard Node.js service. Deployment focuses on environment configuration, process management, and observability.

## Build and run

Install dependencies and start the server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` runs `flowra serve` which initializes the container, registers modules, and starts Express.

## Environment variables

Set your production environment:

```bash
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

Configure database and cache as needed. Use `.env` or your platform's secret manager.

## Health checks

Use the CLI to validate database connectivity:

```bash
flowra health:check --json
```

For lightweight readiness checks, `flowra serve --once` starts and exits after the server is ready.

## Process managers

Flowra runs well under:

- systemd
- PM2
- Docker
- Kubernetes

Just ensure the Node process is restarted on failure and logs are collected.

## Static assets and views

- `public/` is served as static assets.
- `resources/views/` contains EJS templates.

:::tip Production logs
Enable file logging in `app/Config/Logger.js` to persist logs in `storage/logs`.
