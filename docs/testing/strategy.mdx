description: 'Use Node’s built-in test runner and Flowra’s modular structure to test services and routes.'
---

Flowra does not impose a testing framework. The scaffold uses Node’s built-in test runner (`node:test`) for fast, dependency-free tests.

## Running tests

```bash
npm test
```

The default script runs:

```bash
node --test
```

## Example unit test

```js title="tests/project.test.js"
const test = require('node:test');
const assert = require('node:assert/strict');
const pkg = require('../package.json');

test('package metadata is initialised', () => {
  assert.ok(pkg.name);
  assert.ok(pkg.version);
});
```

## Integration tests

Spin up the app via `createApp()` and test routes with a HTTP client like `supertest`:

```js
const request = require('supertest');
const { createApp } = require('../app/Bootstrap/server.bootstrap');

test('GET /status returns ok', async () => {
  const { app } = createApp();
  const response = await request(app).get('/status');
  assert.equal(response.statusCode, 200);
});
```

:::note Dependencies
`supertest` is not included by default. Install it when you need integration tests.
