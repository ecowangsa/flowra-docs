Flowra configuration is file-based and environment-driven. Runtime settings live in `app/Config` and are loaded through the `config()` helper.

## How config works

`core/Support/config.js` reads JavaScript files inside `app/Config` and exposes them via a simple API:

```js
const config = require('./core/Support/config');

const port = config('app.port');
const database = config('database');
const all = config.all();
```

Config keys follow a `namespace.key` pattern. The namespace maps to a file in `app/Config`.

## Default config files

- `app/Config/App.js` - app settings, HTTP options, providers
- `app/Config/Database.js` - Knex connections and pools
- `app/Config/Cache.js` - cache stores and defaults
- `app/Config/Logger.js` - logging output and transport settings
- `app/Config/Model.js` - base model behavior
- `app/Config/Service.js` - base service helpers and database access
- `app/Config/Validation.js` - request validation rules

## Environment variables

Most config values are derived from `.env`. Use the CLI to generate a fresh example:

```bash
flowra env:example
```

See [Environment Variables](./environment) for the full list.

:::tip Keep config close to the app
Because config is file-based, teams can audit changes easily and review production settings in code.
