title: Code of Conduct
description: Our commitment to a welcoming, respectful Flowra community.
---

Flowra is a community-first project. We expect all contributors, maintainers, and community members to keep interactions respectful, inclusive, and professional.

## Our pledge

We are committed to providing a welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of experience level, identity, or background.

## Expected behavior

- Be kind, constructive, and considerate.
- Give feedback with empathy and focus on the work.
- Respect differing viewpoints and approaches.
- Assume positive intent and ask clarifying questions.

## Unacceptable behavior

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind.
- Personal attacks, insults, or hostile language.
- Sharing private information without consent.
- Sustained disruption of community discussions.

## Reporting issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the maintainers. Use the contact method listed in the repository README or reach out through GitHub Discussions or Issues. Sensitive reports should be marked clearly so they can be handled privately.

## Enforcement

Maintainers will review reports promptly and may take action including warnings, content removal, or temporary or permanent bans from community spaces.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all Flowra spaces, including GitHub repositories, documentation sites, and community channels.

## Attribution

This policy is inspired by common open source community standards and tailored for Flowra.
