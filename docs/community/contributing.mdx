---

Thank you for helping improve Flowra. Contributions are welcome across the CLI, framework, and docs.

## Ways to contribute

- Report bugs or request features with clear reproduction steps.
- Improve documentation by adding examples, clarifying wording, or fixing typos.
- Build new CLI generators or framework modules that help teams ship faster.
- Share templates, snippets, or recipes that make Flowra easier to adopt.

## Repository map

- `docs/` holds the documentation content.
- `src/` holds the docs site UI components and styles.
- `static/` holds images and assets.
- The Flowra CLI and framework live in the main repo and are linked from the docs.

## Local setup (docs)

1. Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the docs site in dev mode.

```bash
npm run start
```

3. Build the production site before opening a PR.

```bash
npm run build
```

## Contribution workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make focused changes that solve a single problem.
3. Run the build and verify there are no errors.
4. Open a PR and describe the change, screenshots, and tests.

## Documentation standards

- Use clear, action-first headings.
- Prefer runnable code examples and full commands.
- Keep steps numbered and avoid long nested lists.
- Add or update Indonesian translations for user-facing docs.

## Pull request checklist

- Changes are scoped to one goal.
- `npm run build` succeeds locally.
- New docs have working links.
- Screenshots included for visual changes.
- Translations updated when content is user-facing.

## Help us review faster

If you are changing the CLI or framework, link to the related issue and describe how the change affects:

- project scaffolding
- module structure
- CLI output or flags
- configuration or environment variables

We appreciate every contribution, from typo fixes to major new capabilities.
