description: 'The Flowra CLI powers project creation, scaffolding, and operational commands.'
---

Flowra CLI ships as the `flowra` executable. It scaffolds projects, manages modules, and wraps common operational tasks like migrations and health checks.

## Install and run

```bash
npm install -g flowra-cli
flowra --help
```

If installed locally:

```bash
npm install --save-dev flowra-cli
npx flowra --help
```

## Project detection

All commands except `create-app` and `list` must be run inside a Flowra project. The CLI detects a project when `package.json` contains `flowra` or `flowra-cli` in dependencies.

## Handy commands

```bash
flowra list
flowra serve
flowra serve:watch
flowra route:list
flowra module:list
flowra health:check
```
