Flowra ships with a TypeScript-powered CLI located at `bin/flowra.ts`. It bootstraps the service container, discovers commands, and provides generators that automate repetitive tasks.

## CLI entrypoint

```ts title="bin/flowra.ts"
import 'reflect-metadata';
import {Command} from 'commander';
import {registerCommands} from '../app/commands';

const program = new Command();
program.name('flowra').description('Flowra command line interface').version('1.0.0');

registerCommands(program);

program.parseAsync();
```

- `reflect-metadata` enables decorators used by the service container.
- Commands live in `app/commands` and register themselves with Commander.

## Command discovery

Each command exports a function that accepts the Commander program instance:

```ts title="app/commands/make-module.ts"
import type {Command} from 'commander';
import {scaffoldModule} from '../scaffolding/module-generator';

export const registerMakeModuleCommand = (program: Command) => {
  program
    .command('make:module <name>')
    .description('Generate a module with controller, service, routes, and tests')
    .action(async name => {
      await scaffoldModule(name);
      console.log(`Module ${name} created.`);
    });
};
```

`registerCommands(program)` imports all command modules and invokes their registration functions.

## Available commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `flowra make:module <name>` | Generates a module skeleton with controllers, services, models, and tests. |
| `flowra make:controller <module> <name>` | Adds a controller to an existing module. |
| `flowra make:service <module> <name>` | Generates a new service class and updates the container bindings. |
| `flowra make:migration <name>` | Creates a timestamped Knex migration. |
| `flowra make:seed <name>` | Generates a seed script for test or demo data. |
| `flowra list` | Displays registered modules and routes (useful for audits). |
| `flowra dev` | Boots the development server with hot reload (alias for `npm run dev`). |

:::note Custom commands
Add new commands under `app/commands`. Ensure they call into reusable scaffolding utilities stored in `resources/templates` when generating files.
:::

## Configuration and templates

- `resources/templates` stores stub files used by generators (controllers, services, tests).
- Update templates to enforce your team's coding standards.
- Use placeholders like `__MODULE__` inside templates and replace them programmatically in generators.

## Error handling and logging

- Wrap async command actions in try/catch to display friendly error messages.
- Use the shared logger (`container.resolve('logger')`) when commands need structured logging.

The CLI acts as the automation backbone for Flowra projects—learn it well and keep it up to date as your architecture evolves.
