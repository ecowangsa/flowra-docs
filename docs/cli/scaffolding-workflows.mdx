Flowra generators are designed to keep naming and structure consistent across modules. They write CommonJS files that match the scaffolded project style.

## Module scaffold

```bash
flowra make:module billing --controllers payments,refunds
```

Creates:

- `app/Modules/Billing/billing.module.js`
- `app/Modules/Billing/billing.container.js`
- `app/Modules/Billing/billing.routes.js`
- Controller files for each controller segment
- `Billing.service.js`, `Billing.validator.js`, `Billing.query.js`

The module is also added to `app/Modules/modules.manifest.js` automatically.

## Model generation

```bash
flowra make:model user --module users --table users --db default
```

Creates a model in the module directory (`Users.model.js`) that extends the `Model` base class.

If you omit `--module`, the model is created under `app/Models` (created if missing).

## Controller and service generation

```bash
flowra make:controller audit --module users
flowra make:service audit --module users
```

These commands generate new files inside the target module and leave wiring up to you.

## Route generation

```bash
flowra make:route audit --module users
```

Generates a simple route file and binds it to the module's main controller. You can import and call the route function from your module routes file.

## Validator generation

```bash
flowra make:validator user --module users
```

Generates a Zod-based validator file. Remember to install `zod` if it is not already in your project.

## Query generation

```bash
flowra make:query report --module analytics
```

Creates a query helper class for read-only operations.

## Resource scaffold

```bash
flowra make:resource tasks
```

Generates a module scaffold plus:

- A model for the resource
- `resource.routes.js` with RESTful routes

After running, update your module to use the `resource.routes.js` file or merge those routes into your existing module routes.

:::tip Prefer the CLI
The CLI generates container wiring and naming conventions that are easy to miss by hand.
