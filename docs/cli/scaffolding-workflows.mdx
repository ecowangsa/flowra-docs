title: 'Scaffolding Workflows'
description: 'End-to-end workflows that use the Flowra CLI to deliver new features quickly.'

The Flowra CLI accelerates team workflows by generating consistent modules, tests, and migrations. Below are recommended playbooks you can adapt for your organisation.

## Workflow 1: New domain module

1. **Generate the module**
   ```bash
   npx flowra make:module billing
   ```
2. **Create supporting resources**
   ```bash
   npx flowra make:controller billing invoice
   npx flowra make:service billing create-invoice
   npx flowra make:migration create_invoices_table
   ```
3. **Implement business logic**
   - Fill in the controller and service classes.
   - Add a model (`app/modules/billing/models/invoice-model.ts`).
4. **Wire routes and register module** in `main/bootstrap.ts`.
5. **Write tests** using generated stubs in `__tests__`.
6. **Run migrations and seeds** to populate sample data.

Commit generated scaffolding before adding logic. It makes reviews easier and keeps diffs focused.

## Workflow 2: Expand an existing feature

1. **Add a service and controller method**
   ```bash
   npx flowra make:service users reset-password
   npx flowra make:controller users reset-password
   ```
2. **Update routes**
   - Register a new endpoint in `app/modules/users/routes.ts`.
3. **Add validation**
   - Create a validator in `validators/reset-password-schema.ts`.
4. **Adjust container bindings**
   - Ensure the module's `index.ts` exports the new classes.
5. **Write integration tests**
   - Use CLI-generated test stubs or create new ones under `__tests__`.

## Workflow 3: Background job pipeline

1. **Generate a module with job support**
   ```bash
   npx flowra make:module reports
   ```
2. **Create a queue worker**
   - Add a job class in `app/modules/reports/jobs/generate-report-job.ts`.
3. **Expose a CLI task**
   ```bash
   npx flowra make:command reports:generate
   ```
4. **Schedule the job**
   - Register the command in `app/commands/index.ts` and integrate with your scheduler (e.g., cron, BullMQ).
5. **Test end-to-end**
   - Write tests that enqueue jobs and assert outputs in storage or email.

## Productivity tips

- **Use dry runs** — Many generators accept `--dry-run` to preview files without writing them.
- **Custom templates** — Tailor files in `resources/templates` to enforce security headers, logging, or telemetry by default.
- **Pair with linting** — Run `npm run lint` after scaffolding to catch formatting issues early.
- **Script common sequences** — Wrap CLI commands in npm scripts (e.g., `npm run make:feature users`) to capture team conventions.

:::warning Review generated code
Scaffolding jumpstarts development but still requires review. Verify dependency bindings, test coverage, and data access patterns before merging.

By standardising workflows, teams deliver features faster while keeping Flowra applications consistent and maintainable.
