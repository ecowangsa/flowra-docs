description: 'Install the Flowra CLI, create a new project, and run the development server.'
---

This guide covers installing Flowra, generating a project, and running the dev server.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Node.js | 18+ (LTS recommended) |
| Package manager | npm, yarn, or pnpm |
| Database | MySQL by default (can be changed in config) |

## Install the CLI

Global install:

```bash
npm install -g flowra-cli
```

Project-local install (recommended for teams and CI):

```bash
npm install --save-dev flowra-cli
```

When installed locally, run commands with `npx flowra`.

## Create a project

```bash
flowra create-app my-flowra-app
```

You can override the default framework version used in `package.json`:

```bash
flowra create-app my-flowra-app --framework-version 1.0.0
```

## Install dependencies and run

```bash
cd my-flowra-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

The `dev` script uses `flowra serve:watch` (hot reload). For a production-style run:

```bash
npm start
```

## Configure environment variables

Copy the default environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The scaffold includes MySQL defaults. Update these values to match your database:

- `DB_MYSQL_HOST_PRIMARY`
- `DB_MYSQL_PORT_PRIMARY`
- `DB_DEFAULT_USERNAME`
- `DB_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`
- `DB_DEFAULT_DATABASE`

If you want to use a different database, update `app/Config/Database.js` accordingly.

## Sanity checks

List available routes and verify database connectivity:

```bash
flowra route:list
flowra health:check
```
