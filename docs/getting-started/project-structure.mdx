description: 'Learn how a Flowra application is organised and where to place your code as the project grows.'

Flowra enforces a predictable layout so every module feels familiar. The scaffold separates framework internals from application code and highlights the folders you will touch most often.

## Repository overview

```text
flowra/
├─ app/
│  ├─ modules/
│  ├─ services/
│  └─ jobs/
├─ bin/
│  └─ flowra.ts
├─ config/
│  ├─ app.ts
│  ├─ database.ts
│  └─ queue.ts
├─ core/
│  ├─ container/
│  ├─ http/
│  ├─ database/
│  └─ testing/
├─ main/
│  ├─ bootstrap.ts
│  └─ server.ts
├─ public/
├─ resources/
└─ package.json
```

### Key directories

- **`app/modules`** — Home to feature modules. Each module bundles `controllers`, `services`, `routes.ts`, optional `validators`, and domain-specific config.
- **`app/services`** — Cross-cutting services shared by multiple modules (e.g., email, queue publishers). Register them in the container.
- **`app/jobs`** — Background jobs managed via queues or schedulers, usually resolved from the container.
- **`bin/flowra.ts`** — CLI entrypoint that bootstraps commands from `app/commands`.
- **`config/`** — Environment-aware configuration files. They expose typed objects consumed by the container.
- **`core/`** — Framework primitives such as the HTTP kernel, exception handler, and DI container wiring. You rarely modify these but can extend them.
- **`main/`** — Application bootstrap: builds the container, registers modules, and starts the HTTP server.
- **`resources/`** — Templates and stub files used by the CLI when scaffolding.

:::tip Module-first mindset
Treat `app/modules/<domain>` as the default home for business logic. Shared utilities should live in `app/services` only when they truly span modules.

## Module anatomy

A typical module contains:

```text
app/modules/users/
├─ controllers/
│  └─ create-user-controller.ts
├─ services/
│  └─ create-user-service.ts
├─ validators/
│  └─ create-user-validator.ts
├─ models/
│  └─ user-model.ts
└─ routes.ts
```

- `controllers/` orchestrate HTTP behaviour and depend on services.
- `services/` contain domain logic and interact with models or repositories.
- `validators/` house schema definitions for request validation (e.g., Zod, Yup, or custom logic).
- `models/` wrap Knex queries and transactions.
- `routes.ts` exports a function that registers routes on the Express router.

## Where developers spend time

1. **Controllers and services** – implementing features and orchestrating dependencies.
2. **Models and repositories** – structuring database access and migrations.
3. **Configuration** – adding environment-specific settings and secrets.
4. **Tests** – integration tests live next to modules (`app/modules/<domain>/__tests__`).

:::note Watching for consistency
Use the CLI generators (`npx flowra make:module users`) to enforce naming conventions, TypeScript strictness, and dependency registration. Hand-written files can easily miss container bindings.
