Flowra is a modular Node.js framework built on Express. It gives teams a clear structure, a dependency-injected service container, and a CLI that scaffolds consistent code. You write plain JavaScript, keep Express semantics, and gain a framework that scales with your API.

## At a glance

- **Express-compatible HTTP layer** with familiar middleware and routing.
- **Module-first architecture** that groups routes, controllers, services, and models.
- **Dependency injection** through a container that resolves services by name.
- **Knex-powered data layer** with multiple connection aliases.
- **CLI tooling** for scaffolding, migrations, health checks, and cleanup.

## Core building blocks

| Block | Purpose | Where it lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Modules | Feature slices containing routes, controllers, services, and models | `app/Modules/` |
| Container | Dependency injection and scoped module registration | `app/Bootstrap/Container/` |
| HTTP bootstrap | Express setup, middleware, and routing | `app/Bootstrap/server.bootstrap.js` |
| Configuration | Environment-driven config for app, DB, cache, logging | `app/Config/` |
| CLI | Project creation, generators, and dev utilities | `flowra` (from `flowra-cli`) |

## A minimal module

Create a module with the CLI:

```bash
flowra make:module status
```

Flowra wires the module into `app/Modules/modules.manifest.js` and generates the boilerplate. A route file looks like this:

```js title="app/Modules/Status/status.routes.js"
'use strict';

function registerStatusRoutes({ router, container } = {}) {
  if (!router || !container) {
    return router;
  }

  const controller = container.resolve('modules.status.controllers.main');
  router.get('/status', controller.index.bind(controller));

  return router;
}

module.exports = registerStatusRoutes;
```

The generated controller already calls the service layer, so you only need to update the service method to return meaningful data:

```js title="app/Modules/Status/Status.service.js"
'use strict';

class StatusService {
  async list() {
    return {
      ok: true,
      uptime: process.uptime(),
      node: process.version,
    };
  }
}

module.exports = StatusService;
```

Start the server and hit `GET /status`.
