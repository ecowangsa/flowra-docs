Flowra is a modular Node.js backend framework focused on helping product teams evolve APIs without losing control over their architecture. It layers an opinionated core on top of Express, pairing a dependency-injected service container with a predictable module layout, a Knex-powered data layer, and a batteries-included CLI.

## Why Flowra exists

Modern API teams often start with plain Express and quickly run into the same challenges:

- **Architecture drift.** Without conventions, every module ends up structured differently, making onboarding hard and refactoring risky.
- **Ad-hoc dependency wiring.** Manual `require` chains and singleton exports leak implementation details and complicate testing.
- **Inconsistent data access.** Query builders, raw SQL, and ORMs coexist without standards, slowing down reviews.
- **No shared tooling.** Every team reinvents scaffolding scripts, seeding workflows, and lint-friendly code generation.

Flowra solves these pains by codifying a clear, modular architecture that scales from MVPs to enterprise backends.

:::note Foundation on Express
Flowra keeps the familiar Express request/response semantics under the hood. Anything you can do in Express—custom middleware, low-level response streaming, SSR—is still possible, but wrapped in stronger conventions.

## Core concepts

| Concept | Description | Where to look |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Modules** | Independent feature slices bundling routes, controllers, services, and supporting files under `app/modules/<domain>` | `app/modules/example` |
| **Service container** | An inversion-of-control container that resolves dependencies for controllers, services, and jobs | `core/container/application-container.ts` |
| **Knex data layer** | Centralised database configuration with multi-connection support using Knex | `core/database` + `config/database.ts` |
| **CLI** | Type-safe command runner that scaffolds modules, controllers, migrations, and more | `bin/flowra.ts` + `app/commands` |

Each Flowra application begins at `main/bootstrap.ts`, where the container is built, modules are registered, and the HTTP server starts listening.

## A minimal Flowra endpoint

Creating a new endpoint is a matter of wiring a module, controller, and service. Below is the abbreviated output of the Flowra CLI after running `npx flowra make:module health`:

```text
app/
  modules/
    health/
      controllers/
        health-controller.ts
      routes.ts
      services/
        health-service.ts
```

The generated controller and service give you clean separation between HTTP handling and business logic:

```ts title="app/modules/health/controllers/health-controller.ts"
import {injectable} from 'tsyringe';
import type {Request, Response} from 'express';
import {HealthService} from '../services/health-service';

@injectable()
export class HealthController {
  constructor(private readonly service: HealthService) {}

  async index(req: Request, res: Response) {
    const payload = await this.service.getStatus();
    return res.json(payload);
  }
}
```

```ts title="app/modules/health/services/health-service.ts"
import {injectable} from 'tsyringe';

@injectable()
export class HealthService {
  async getStatus() {
    return {status: 'ok', uptime: process.uptime()};
  }
}
```

```ts title="app/modules/health/routes.ts"
import {Router} from 'express';
import {useController} from '../../core/http/controller-resolver';
import {HealthController} from './controllers/health-controller';

export const registerHealthRoutes = (router: Router) => {
  router.get('/health', useController(HealthController, 'index'));
};
```

With routes registered in `main/bootstrap.ts`, hitting `GET /health` yields a JSON response without the controller worrying about how its dependencies are created.
