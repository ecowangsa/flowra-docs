Use this checklist to upgrade Flowra safely.

## 1. Review the changelog

Read the [Flowra CLI changelog](https://github.com/ecowangsa/flowra-cli/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) before upgrading.

## 2. Upgrade the CLI

Global install:

```bash
npm install -g flowra-cli@latest
```

Project-local install:

```bash
npm install --save-dev flowra-cli@latest
```

## 3. Update dependencies

If the scaffold adds or bumps dependencies, update your `package.json` and run:

```bash
npm install
```

## 4. Run tests and lint

```bash
npm test
npm run lint
```

## 5. Validate runtime

```bash
flowra env:check
flowra health:check
```

:::tip Upgrade in stages
For larger upgrades, move one minor/major version at a time and keep rollback options ready.
