description: 'How Flowra versions the CLI, how projects pin dependencies, and where to track changes.'
---

Flowra is distributed as an npm package (`flowra-cli`). The CLI version is the primary release artifact and is used to scaffold projects.

## How versions map to projects

When you run:

```bash
flowra create-app my-app
```

Flowra pins the generated project to the current CLI version. You can override that version with:

```bash
flowra create-app my-app --framework-version 1.0.0
```

This controls the `flowra-cli` version saved in `package.json`.

## Checking the CLI version

```bash
flowra --version
```

## Compatibility notes

The default scaffold includes:

- Node.js 18+ support
- Express 4.x
- Knex 3.x
- MySQL2 3.x

If you upgrade dependencies, confirm them in `package.json` and run your tests.

## Where to track changes
